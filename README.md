MPC with improved gradient based parameter estimator
This project utilizes the CasAdi package within Matlab to design an MPC controller enhanced with a superior gradient parameter estimator, 
which is adept at adapting to unknown road grades. 
For more detailed information about the project, please refer to the Readme.pdf.
The CasAdi program, necessary for this project, can be obtained from [its official website](https://web.casadi.org/get/) or directly from its GitHub repository.
